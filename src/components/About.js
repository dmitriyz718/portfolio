        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
          Originaly started off studying computer science at WKU dual majoring
          in Business Administration. I've worked for several companies in the
          IT department, but began my career as a contractor for Cisco Systems
          in California.

        <p>
          Shortly after, I set up the IT infrastructure for a company that sells
          products on Amazon, Wayfair, and so on. I kept this role for quite a
          while, doing what I could to improve business and client interactions
          with their websites, however I did not feel challenged, which is why I
          began my journey at General Assembly in the Software Engineering
          Immersive. Having graduated with a 100% completion rate, I feel my
          addition to any team would greatly benefit any entity both from my
          technical expertise as well as creativity

        <h2>Why software engineering?</h2>
        <p>
          For me, software engineering is a passion and a great fit for my
          thought process. I was once asked to survey a website that was about
          to go public, and without even thinking, instead of looking at the
          website, I instinctively opened my dev tools and began to analyze the
          site from the inside out... checking for responsive designs and so on.
          The person conducting the survey ended up asking me if that is how I
          view all the websites that I initially visit. I see code and the final
          product that it produces. My passion is the development of web
          applications that are easy to use and better the users experience.
