        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>
          Originaly started off studying computer science at WKU dual majoring
          in Business Administration. I've worked for several companies in the
          IT department with being a contractor for Cisco Systems in California
          being my first job. Unfortunately, that role had me travel to over 10
          states and cities within just the first couple of months so I had to
          resign due to me wanting to spend more time at home.
        </p>

          Shortly after, I set up the IT infrastructure for a company that sells
          products on Amazon, Wayfair, and so on. I kept this role for quite a
          while, doing what I can to improve business and client interactions
          with their websites, however I did not feel challenged, which
          eventually led me to begin my journey at General Assembly in the
          Software Engineering Immersive. Having graduated with a 100%
          completion rate, I feel my addition to any team would greatly benefit
          any entity both from my technical expertise as well as creativity

        <h2>Why software engineering?</h2>
        <p>
          A combination of passion as well as my overall thinking process. I was
          asked once to survey a website that was about to go public, and
          without even thinking, instead of looking at the website, I instead
          instinctively opened my dev tools and began to analyze the site from
          the inside out checking for responsive designs and so on. The person
          conducting the survey ended up asking me if that is how I view all the
          websites that I initially visit. I see code and the final product that
          it produces. My passion is the development of web applications that
          are easy to use and better the users experience.
